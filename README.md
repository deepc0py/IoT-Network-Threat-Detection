Of course. Here is the project baseline converted into a GitHub README format. I have maintained all the original information and links while also identifying and filling in common gaps found in project documentation, such as setup instructions, usage examples, and a suggested project structure.

# Detecting Malicious Network Traffic in IoT Devices using Machine Learning

## About The Project

[cite\_start]As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices grows, so does the exposure to cyber threats[cite: 4]. [cite\_start]These threats often materialize in the background of a network, making them difficult for an average user to detect and defend against[cite: 5]. [cite\_start]Many IoT devices are lightweight systems without robust security controls, making them frequent targets for malicious activities like DDoS attacks, backdoors, and ransomware[cite: 6, 7].

[cite\_start]This project tests the hypothesis that malicious traffic in IoT networks exhibits statistically detectable patterns that can be classified using machine learning techniques[cite: 8, 37]. [cite\_start]We will train supervised classifiers and explore anomaly detection methods to distinguish between benign and malicious network traffic, contributing to more proactive network defense and monitoring[cite: 38, 39, 41].

## Datasets

### Primary Dataset

  * [cite\_start]**TON\_IoT:** Provided by the UNSW Canberra Cyber, Australian Centre for Cyber Security[cite: 12, 13]. [cite\_start]This dataset contains CSV-formatted network logs, with each row representing a network flow that is labeled for both binary and multi-class classification[cite: 14, 20]. [cite\_start]It is ideal for this project because it includes diverse, real-world attack types and protocols[cite: 21].
      * [cite\_start]**Link:** [https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/toniot-datasets](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/toniot-datasets) [cite: 12]
      * [cite\_start]**Features Include:** Source/destination IPs and ports, packet/byte counts, flow duration, protocol (HTTP, TCP, MQTT, etc.), and traffic type labels (e.g., benign, DDoS, Backdoor)[cite: 15, 16, 17, 18].

### Secondary Datasets

  * [cite\_start]**Bot-IoT Dataset:** [https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/bot-iot-dataset](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/bot-iot-dataset) [cite: 23, 24]
  * [cite\_start]**UNSW-NB15 Dataset:** [https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset) [cite: 25, 26]
  * [cite\_start]**UNB CIC-IDS2017:** [https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html) [cite: 27]

## Gaps Identified and Filled

The initial baseline provides a strong "why" but lacks the "how" for a developer to begin work. The following sections fill those gaps.

### Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
    ```
2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Download the Datasets**
    Place the primary TON\_IoT dataset in the `data/` directory.

### Project Structure

A well-organized project structure is crucial. We recommend the following layout:

```
.
├── data/              # Raw and processed datasets
├── notebooks/         # Jupyter notebooks for EDA and experimentation
├── src/               # Source code for the project
│   ├── preprocess.py  # Scripts for data cleaning and feature engineering
│   ├── train.py       # Script for training the ML model
│   └── evaluate.py    # Script for evaluating model performance
├── models/            # Saved trained models
├── requirements.txt   # Project dependencies
└── README.md
```

### Usage

This section outlines how to use the scripts to run the machine learning pipeline.

1.  **Preprocess the Data**
    ```sh
    python src/preprocess.py --input_path data/ton_iot.csv --output_path data/processed_data.csv
    ```
2.  **Train the Model**
    ```sh
    python src/train.py --data_path data/processed_data.csv --model_dest_path models/random_forest.pkl
    ```
3.  **Evaluate the Model**
    ```sh
    python src/evaluate.py --model_path models/random_forest.pkl --test_data_path data/test_data.csv
    ```

## Methodology

[cite\_start]Our approach is to train supervised classifiers to distinguish between benign and malicious traffic[cite: 38]. [cite\_start]We will also explore unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify new, unseen threats[cite: 39].

### Evaluation

Model performance will be rigorously measured using standard metrics:

  * [cite\_start]Precision [cite: 40]
  * [cite\_start]Recall [cite: 40]
  * [cite\_start]F1-Score [cite: 40]

[cite\_start]A final live network test will be conducted to confirm real-world functionality[cite: 40].

## Potential Challenges

We anticipate several challenges in this project:

  * **Imbalanced Data:** Some attack types are rare. [cite\_start]This can be mitigated by using techniques like class weights during training[cite: 29].
  * **Multi-protocol Noise:** The dataset contains traffic from various protocols. [cite\_start]We may mitigate this by focusing on a single protocol initially[cite: 30].
  * **Feature Scaling:** Network features often exist on vastly different scales. [cite\_start]This can be handled by normalizing the data or using tree-based models which are robust to scaling issues[cite: 33, 34].
  * **Overfitting:** Models might overfit to the dataset's specific environment. [cite\_start]Cross-validation and testing on secondary datasets will be used to ensure generalizability[cite: 32].
  * **High Data Volume:** Network data can be very large. [cite\_start]We will focus on efficient data processing pipelines[cite: 35].
